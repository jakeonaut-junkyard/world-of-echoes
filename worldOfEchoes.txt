TODO::
1. Avatars can change the fundamental note of the scale of the world (but the world keeps the same scale pattern (e.g. major/minor) -- CHORD CHANGES
2. Learn how to make multiplayer online
	Things to add to the 'server computer' calculation duties and take off the local
		i. Voice Orb Lifespan/Creation
		ii. All the notes/bursts/etc. created by players (translate relevant objects to local)
		iii. Player positions (translate relevant avatar locations/voice/color to local)
3. Create More Areas (a couple more) and expand the ones you have physically
	A. Create uniqueish color palettes/theme for each one around the scale
	B. Create little musical lifeforms and other interactive things in each area (thematically consistent)
4. VOICE ORB STUFF::
	A. When building levels/areas, make voice orbs randomly created every now and then.
	B. Make voices match up with colors??? (categorically)
		
--TODO::---NOT-AS-IMPORTANT-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Add Options on Pause to change controls:: qwerasdf && arrow keys
	
====================================================================================================
Systemic Mechanics:: Sensation/Fellowship/Discovery

Possibilities for individualized musical note expression::
1. Each world that you occupy has a unique musical scale that it operates on (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)).
	-It's possible to find "dischordant" instruments
	
	-There are "stages" around the world grouped together, if you stand on a "stage" you can use your full keyboard (similar to madtracker and the like) to play a wider range of notes...
	-A special "virus" instrument keeps randomly changing your voice 
		
	NOTES:: (Range from 24 (pushing it) to 76)
		Ab: if ((x+4)%12==0)
		A:  if ((x+3)%12==0)
		Bb: if ((x+2)%12==0)
		B:  if ((x+1)%12==0)
		C:  if (x%12==0)
		Db: if ((x-1)%12==0)
		D:  if ((x-2)%12==0)
		Eb: if ((x-3)%12==0)
		E:  if ((x-4)%12==0)
		F:  if ((x-5)%12==0)
		Gb: if ((x-6)%12==0)
		G:  if ((x-7)%12==0)

WORLD AREAS::

1. Pentatonic Major Scale Starting Area fluffy forest field
2. Cave of Silence/footsteps and Leaky Drops (light in the dark)
3. Full Chromatic Chaotic Practice Area Wastelands
4. Diatonic Minor Scale

====================================================================================================
Artistic sounding ideas that I like the sound of but don't know exactly how to implement::

1. Little creatures make unique npc noises and are unique to environments. 
2. Make a bassline/rhythm section for different map areas (except the silent cave tunnel area/practice rooms?).
	A. How can we implement the ability for avatars to affect this bassline somehow?
	B. The bass reverberating with the ground.
3. How should avatars semipermanently affect the visual space (besides just burst visualizations)
4. Create a few various avatar species sprite things with various starting color palettes
5. I like seiklus style mystery stuff:: (the piano that unlocks a new area:: do this with teamwork)
6. The division of public and private space (performances and practices)
7. Spawn as one of three or so sound classes (alto, mezzo, bass). 
9. Randomly generated noise sink bosses can only be defeated by accumulating people to work together
