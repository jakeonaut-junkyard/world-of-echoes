WORLD OF ECHOES REVISED FEBRUARY 2013!!!
1. Pressing the x button generates a noise "hum". The frequency/rhythm at which you press and the duration of each button press it affects its pitch/tone?? Environment affects key.
2. Every environment that you explore (see below, interconnected, see seiklus and fez) is completely dark (colorless and shadowed) and silent, but "humming" can bring color and noise to the environments.
3. Different parts of the environment (solids, nonsolids, critters, secrets, etc) are uncovered at different hum pitches/tones or something.
4. Explore the landscape and uncover hidden things using your echo/hum ability, and find and collect uh "essences" or whatever.

TODO::
3. Add environmental objects (ambience audiovisually) that fit the theme of the area you're in
	i. Little animals that hop away from you (grasshoppers etc.) and follow you a bit(doggies/birdy/fishy)
