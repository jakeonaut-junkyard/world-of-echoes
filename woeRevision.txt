1. Hold spacebar/x/something to charge a notepulse. Release to play it (time of charge scales to make volume of note and extra double jump. Holding the note makes you float). Arrow keys walk around like normal. 
	-When a note is released, it plays a random note that alternates on a chord on a chord progression.
	-If there are other humans around and they release notes while yours is also released, the notes harmonize.
2. Spawn in a mini area world. You can walk left or right out of it to a new room.
	i. Each time you go left or right, you enter a new room. This room is either generated at the time of walking through (randomly based on a few conditions discussed below) or you are put in a room that already exists with another human in it. 
		a. Main theme of room:: (p.s. little cats hidden throughout)
			-Summer Buggy Treeland Field Forest (Cicadas, Grasshoppers, Wind blowing through leaves, Green) [Japanese Countryside]
			-Deep mushroom forest [Japanese Forest]
			-Rocky Orange-Water Beach (Seagulls, waves on shore and crashing, fishies jumping) [Rocky sunset beach]
			-Chilly Caverns [oot ice cavern?]
			-Asian Paper Lantern neon arcade vending machine(beeps boops neon electric, that one fez world alley) [Tokyo night]
		b. Weather condition (or mix)
			-Normal, no weather
			-Rain (lesser % chance)
		c. Big creature/secret?
			
	ii. Each time you are in a room with a human, you two are momentarily "imprinted" on each other, and if one of you exits the room, you may go back to it if they have stayed in it (and they may follow you to the next room if you are still in it). However, if you both leave the room that you were "imprinted" in (or one is disconnected), you lose your imprinting and go your seperate ways.
